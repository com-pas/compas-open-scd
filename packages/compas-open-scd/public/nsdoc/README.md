Directory containing fixed nsdoc for the 'Validation' plugin:

- IEC_61850-7-2_2007XX-en.nsdoc
- IEC_61850-7-3_2007XX-en.nsdoc
- IEC_61850-7-4_2007XX-en.nsdoc
- IEC_61850-8-1_2003XX-en.nsdoc

Where `XX` represents the revision and release values.

This directory should also contain a `manifest.json` file listing all available NSDOC files for dynamic discovery. If the manifest is not present, the system will fall back to pattern-based file discovery.
